## Data Structures and Algorithm
Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA)

### All Data structures and algorithms are implemented in Java (for educational purposes)
These implementations are intended for learning purposes. As such, they may be less efficient than the Java standard library.<br>
This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms concepts and their implementation in several ways, programming questions and Interview questions. The main aim of this repository is to help students and other people who are learning Data Structures and Algorithms or preparing for an interview, logic Building, contest based etc. <br> This contains questions from popular coding platforms including [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions), and many more.
