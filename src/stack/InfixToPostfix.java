    * Problem Statement:
    * Write a program to convert an Infix expression to Postfix form.

    Infix expression: The expression of the form “a operator b” (a + b) i.e., when an operator is in-between every pair of operands.
    Postfix expression: The expression of the form “a b operator” (ab+) i.e., When every pair of operands is followed by an operator.

    Examples:

    Input: A + B * C + D
    Output: ABC*+D+

    Input: ((A + B) – C * (D / E)) + F
    Output: AB+CDE/*-F+
